Hello, and welcome to the organizational page for the CS1 Python Bakery curriculum! The Bakery is an evolution of the original ideas we presented in the [Python Sneks project](https://acbart.github.io/python-sneks/). Our goal is to surpass our predecessor and make a truly instructor-friendly Python CS1 course that can be quickly deployed while still effectively teaching students.

Our resources include:
* 15 weeks of content, broken up into digestible pieces, all ready in a Canvas course template (LINK)
* A parallel Canvas course for training and managing Teaching Assistants and the rest of the course staff (LINK)
* [8 chapters of interactive textbook material](https://blockpy.cis.udel.edu/assignments/textbook/bakery_textbook) including transcribed videos, interactive code examples, self-checking quizzes, and autograded programming problems
* 10 weeks of lecture and lab content, including instructor slides, worksheets, and lesson plans (LINK)
* Grading rubrics, reference answers, and instructor guidance for all worksheets and activities
* Exciting semi-autograded projects, with human grading rubrics and milestones
* Exams, that we in no way claim are good assessments and will probably not share with you :)
* [Indexing cats](https://acbart.github.io/index-the-cat/alpha/)!

The Bakery is built on a few different technologies, including:
* [Pedal](https://github.com/acbart/pedal/), a Python autograding framework
* BlockPy, a dual block/text coding environment with tons of other nifty features
* [CORGIS](http://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis), a collection of really great and interesting dataSets
* Runtime Case Builder, a web-based tool that let's you visualize the estimated run time of algorithms

With the exception of our exams, everything we have created is free and open-source.
