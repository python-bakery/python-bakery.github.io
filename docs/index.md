Hello, and welcome to the organizational page for the CS1 Python Bakery curriculum! The Bakery is an evolution of the original ideas we presented in the [Python Sneks project](https://acbart.github.io/python-sneks/). Our goal is to surpass our predecessor and make a truly instructor-friendly Python CS1 course that can be quickly deployed while still effectively teaching students.

To get full access to all the **instructor-facing materials**, please fill out this form: [https://forms.gle/ZNjmHNhybhWtpq83A](https://forms.gle/ZNjmHNhybhWtpq83A)

To see the **VSCodeEdu** version of this course (edited and improved by Microsoft), check out [vscodeedu.com](https://vscodeedu.com/courses/intro-to-python). This is a free course that comes integrated with a web-based version of VS Code!

Our resources include:
* 15 weeks of content, broken up into digestible pieces, all ready in a Canvas course ([public version](https://canvas.instructure.com/enroll/WAFD8D), [github repository](https://github.com/python-bakery/bakery-curriculum-public)).
* A parallel Canvas course for training and managing Teaching Assistants and the rest of the course staff (*instructors only, [fill out the form](https://forms.gle/ZNjmHNhybhWtpq83A)).
* [8 chapters of interactive textbook material](https://blockpy.cis.udel.edu/assignments/textbook/bakery_textbook) including captioned videos, graphical transcriptions, interactive code examples, self-checking quizzes, and autograded programming problems.
* 10+ weeks of lecture and lab content, including instructor slides, worksheets, and lesson plans.
* Grading rubrics, reference answers, and instructor guidance for all worksheets and activities (*instructors only, [fill out the form](https://forms.gle/ZNjmHNhybhWtpq83A)).
* Exciting mostly-autograded projects, with human grading rubrics and milestones (including [web development with Drafter](https://drafter-edu.github.io/drafter/) and game development with [Designer](https://designer-edu.github.io/)).
* ~~Exams~~ (we're keeping those secret for now :)
* Tools for [converting Markdown into PowerPoint/Videos](https://github.com/python-bakery/bake-mark) and [creating narration for those videos](https://github.com/python-bakery/bake-dubs)
* [Indexing cats](https://acbart.github.io/index-the-cat/alpha/)!

The Bakery is built on a few different technologies, including:
* [Pedal](https://github.com/acbart/pedal/), a Python autograding framework
* [BlockPy](https://blockpy.cis.udel.edu/blockpy/load), a dual block/text coding environment with tons of other nifty features
* [CORGIS](http://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis), a collection of really great and interesting dataSets
* [Runtime Case Builder](https://acbart.github.io/runtime-case-builder/?preload=RCB_find_with_break_dynamic.json), a web-based tool that let's you visualize the estimated run time of algorithms

With the exception of our exams and lesson plans, everything we have created is open-source. We plan to have everything available at some level to teachers. However, we are still exploring ways to release our curriculum in ways that will not damage its instructional validity.

If you are interested in learning more about this project, you can also fill out the [access form](https://forms.gle/ZNjmHNhybhWtpq83A); there is a place for questions. If you don't trust google forms, then you can always email [acbart@udel.edu](mailto:acbart@udel.edu) to learn more about the Python Bakery (warning: Dr. Bart does not promise his inbox is under control).
